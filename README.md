# kETH-Blackhole-POC
kHOLE is a POC smart contract built on top of Blockswap's kETH Vault. The contract allows LST holders to swap to ERC-20 tokens at a discount to market rate (from oracle). Token suppliers are entitled to perpetual fee emissions and a share of minted kETH.

# Featured during ETHCC '23
